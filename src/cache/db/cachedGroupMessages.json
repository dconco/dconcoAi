The toolbox itself is the download, but the tools (the code files) are inside.\n\nYou'll typically find your web files in a folder named something like `htdocs`, `www`, or `public_html` within the ksweb installation directory.

If you're into that, you should totally check out the docs at [phpspa.readthedocs.io](http://phpspa.readthedocs.io).\n\nBasically, I'm here to build awesome things, share my knowledge, and connect with other tech heads.
